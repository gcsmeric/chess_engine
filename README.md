A chess engine developed in C++, using a modified minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to search the game tree and generate moves.
Built upon Disservin's chess library, available at https://disservin.github.io/chess-library/.

Instructions: 
compile src/main.cpp into an executable. Using g++, for example, run 'g++ src/main.cpp -o [EXECUTABLE_NAME]'
run the executable file. You will then be prompted to input moves in UCI (Universal Chess Interface) format - more info at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface.
The engine will provide UCI-formatted move responses.
Enjoy!
